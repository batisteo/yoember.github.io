## <a name='lesson-1'></a>Lesson 1

This tutorial uses the latest Ember CLI tool (v2.3.0-beta.2).

### Install Ember CLI

The following `npm` command installs Ember CLI specified version in the global namespace. At the moment Ember CLI version 2.3 is still in Beta phase, but it is perfect to create new Ember applications. (The Ember.js and Ember Data packages are stable and production ready.)

    $ npm install -g ember-cli@2.3.0-beta.2
    
or 

    $ npm install -g ember-cli@beta

You have now a new `ember` command in your console. Check with

    $ ember -v
    
You should see something similar:

``` bash {% raw %}
version: 2.3.0-beta.2
node: 5.6.0
npm: 2.14.10
os: darwin x64{% endraw %}
```

(Node version, npm version and os version may be different in your configuration.)

Please read more about Ember CLI here: [www.ember-cli.com](http://www.ember-cli.com)

### Create the app

In your terminal, navigate in the folder where you usually create your web applications.
For example, if you have a `projects` folder use 

```
$ cd ~/projects
```

Inside this folder run the following command.

    $ ember new library-app

This command will create the new app for you.

Please change to your new app directory with: 

```
$ cd library-app
```

Open this folder in your favourite code editor and look around. You will see a few files and folders. Ember CLI is scaffolded for you everything what need to run and create an amazing web application. 

### Launch the app

Your skeleton app is ready and you can run it with the following command. Type in your terminal:

    $ ember server

Open your new empty app in your browser: <a href="http://localhost:4200" target="_blank">http://localhost:4200</a>

You should see a "Welcome to Ember" message on your website. Well Done! You have your first Ember.js application. :)

You can open Ember Inspector in your Browser. Hope you've already installed it. Ember Inspector exists in Chrome and in Firefox as an extension. After installation you should have a new tab in your developer console in your browser. Check it out, look around. [More details about Ember Inspector here](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/ember-inspector/installation/). 

### Turn on a few debugging options

If you would like to see more information in your browser's console about what Ember.js is doing under the hood, you can turn on a few debugging options in your configuration file.

You can find a list of debugging options in `./config/environment.js` file. Remove the comment sign as follow:

``` javascript {% raw %}
    //..
    if (environment === 'development') {
      // ENV.APP.LOG_RESOLVER = true;
      ENV.APP.LOG_ACTIVE_GENERATION = true;
      ENV.APP.LOG_TRANSITIONS = true;
      ENV.APP.LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL = true;
      ENV.APP.LOG_VIEW_LOOKUPS = true;
    }
    //..{% endraw %}
```
Check your app and open the Console in Chrome/Firefox. You will see same extra information about what Ember.js actually does under the hood. Don't worry if you don't understand these debug messages at this stage. As you spend more and more time with Ember.js development, these lines are going to be clearer.

### <a name="ember-bootstrap-sass"></a>Add Bootstrap and Sass to Ember.js App

Let's add some basic style to our application. We use Bootstrap with Sass. Ember CLI can install for us add-ons and useful packages. These add-ons are simplify our development process, because we don't have to reinvent the wheel, we get more out of the box. You can find various packages, add-ons on these websites: http://www.emberaddons.com or http://www.emberobserver.com

We install an add-on for Sass and other for Bootstrap.

Exit your `ember server` with `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

Run the following two commands:

```
$ ember install ember-cli-sass
$ ember install ember-cli-bootstrap-sassy
```

You will see, that your `./package.json` and `./bower.json` are extended with a couple of lines.

Rename your `app.css` to `app.scss` with the following terminal command or you can use your editor to rename the `./app/styles/app.css` file:

```
$ mv app/styles/app.css app/styles/app.scss
```

Open `./app/styles/app.scss` file in your editor and add the following line:

```
@import "bootstrap";
```

Relaunch your app with `ember server`. You should see in the browser, that 'Welcome to Ember' uses Bootstrap default font.

Above steps in a one liner. Copy-paste in your console (without $). This is useful if you create a new project and you would like to add Bootstrap in a second.

```
{% raw %}$ ember install ember-cli-sass && ember install ember-cli-bootstrap-sassy && echo '@import "bootstrap";' > ./app/styles/app.scss && rm ./app/styles/app.css{% endraw %}
```

### <a name="navigation-bar"></a>Create a navigation partial

We will use bootstrap navigation bar to create a nice header section for our app.

Update your main template file. Delete the example content and add the following code to your `./app/templates/application.hbs`.

``` html {% raw %}
<div class="container">
  {{partial 'navbar'}}
  {{outlet}}
</div>{% endraw %}
``` 

Ember uses handlebar syntax in templates. It is almost the same as plain html, but you could have dynamic elements with `{% raw %}{{}}{% endraw %}`.

You can insert snippets from other template with `partial` helper.

The `outlet` helper a general helper, a placeholder, where deeper level content will be inserted. The `outlet` in `application.hbs` means, that almost all content from other pages will appear inside this section. For this reason, `application.hbs` is a good place to determine the main structure of our website. In our case we have a `container` div, a navigation bar and the real content.

Generate a `navbar.hbs` file with the following command in you terminal.

    $ ember generate template navbar

You can open `./app/templates/navbar.hbs` in your editor and add the following lines:

```html {% raw %}
<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-navbar">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      {{#link-to 'index' class="navbar-brand"}}Library App{{/link-to}}
    </div>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="main-navbar">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            {{#link-to 'index' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Home</a>{{/link-to}}
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>{% endraw %}
```

Ember provides a bunch of useful handlebar helpers. The `{% raw %}{{#link-to}}{{/link-to}}{% endraw %}` helps to create links. In this case we use as a block helper. The first parameter is the route name (`index`). Inside the block goes the label of the link. `link-to` uses `<a>` tag as default, but you can setup different tag with `tagName` property. We need this little bit hacky solution because of Bootstrap, however later we will implement a [nicer component](#nav-link-to) to manage navigation links.

Launch your application with `ember server`. You should see your new navigation bar in your browser.

You can update your `app.scss` file to add some extra padding to the top. The updated `./app/styles/app.scss` content:

```css
@import "bootstrap";

body {
  padding-top: 20px;
}
```

### <a name="about-page"></a>Create a new About page and add the link to the menu bar

Let's create a new About page.

Run the following command in your terminal

    $ ember generate route about

A new route and template created in your project.

Open your new `./app/templates/about.hbs` file in your editor, delete its content and add the following line:

```html
<h1>About Page</h1>
```    

You can launch your app with `ember server` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/about` page, you should see the created `About Page` header message. If you click on `Home` in your menu bar, your page will be empty. Let's fix that.

Create a new `index` template with the following command in your terminal:

    $ ember generate template index

Open in your editor the generated `./app/templates/index.hbs` file and add the following:

```html
<h1>Home Page</h1>
```

If you launch your app, you should see the above message on your home page, however we still doesn't have `About` link in our menu bar.

Open your `./app/templates/navbar.hbs` and add the following line to the `ul` section under `Home` link:

``` handlebars {% raw %}
    {{#link-to 'about' tagName="li"}}<a href="">About</a>{{/link-to}}{% endraw %}
```

Your `ul` section in `navbar.hbs` should look like this:

``` handlebars {% raw %}
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      {{#link-to 'index' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Home</a>{{/link-to}}
      {{#link-to 'about' tagName="li"}}<a href="">About</a>{{/link-to}}
</ul>{% endraw %}
```

If you check your app in the browser, you should see `Home` and `About` link in your menu bar, you can click on them and you will see how the page content and the url are changed. The `active` state of the link changes the style of the menu link automatically as well. However Bootstrap expect the `active` class in `li` and expects an anchor tag inside the `li` tag. For this reason we have to insert that empty anchor around menu labels. We will fix this with a nice component later. 

### Homework

Create a `Contact` page. Extend the navigation bar with "Contact" menu.

## <a name='lesson-2'></a>Lesson 2

### Coming Soon homepage with an email input box

Let's create a coming soon "jumbotron" on the home page with an email input box, where users can subscribe for a newsletter.

* Bootstrap's jumbotron: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron
* Bootstrap's forms: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms

#### Only static html5 and style

Add a static jumbotron, an input box and a button to `/app/templates/index.hbs`.

```html
    <div class="jumbotron text-center">
        <h1>Coming Soon</h1>

        <br/><br/>

        <p>Don't miss our launch date, request an invitation now.</p>

        <div class="form-horizontal form-group form-group-lg row">
            <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-5 col-md-offset-2">
              <input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Please type your e-mail address." autofocus="autofocus"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-0 col-sm-4 col-md-3">
                <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Request invitation</button>
            </div>

        </div>

        <br/><br/>
    </div>
```

#### Requirements

We would like to cover the following requirements:

* "Invite me" button should be inactive when input box is empty.
* "Invite me" button should be inactive when the content in the input box is not a valid email address.
* Show a response message after clicking on "Invite me" button.
* Clear the input box when invitation sent.

#### isDisabled

We can add dynamic values to standard html properties using conditionals. We can use our controller to add or modify the value of a variable, which we use in our template. Check the following solution. 

We use a boolean variable, let's call it `isDisabled`, which will help us to turn on and off the `disabled` html attribute on our button. We have access to these variables in our controllers and in our templates.

From the official guide:
"Each template has an associated controller: this is where the template finds the properties that it displays. You can display a property from your controller by wrapping the property name in curly braces."

First, update with this variable to your `index.hbs` template.

Add `disabled` property with `{% raw %}{{isDisabled}}{% endraw %}` boolean variable.

``` handlebars {% raw %}
<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" disabled={{isDisabled}}>Request invitation</button>{% endraw %}
``` 

Now we can create our index controller:

    $ ember g controller index

* Read more about Ember controllers here: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/controllers/

Note: Ember.js still uses controllers, however controller layer will be deprecated and will be removed from Ember.js 3.0. We use controller to practice some interesting feature, but later we will refactor our app and we will move most of the logic inside components.

Add `isDisabled` property to the controller. Default value is `true`.

``` javascript {% raw %}
    //app/controllers/index.js
    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Controller.extend({

      isDisabled: true

    }); {% endraw %}
```

You can check your app, the button will be disabled by default. We want to add some logic around this feature. We have to learn a couple of new Ember.js features for that.

#### Computed Properties and Observers

Computed Properties and Observers are important features of Ember.js. Please read more about it in the official guide first.

* Computed Properties: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/object-model/computed-properties/
* Observers: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/object-model/observers/

Please note, I will use the new, preferred syntax in our project. You could ask, was there some other syntax before? Yes.

Computed properties and observers still could be written in two ways, however the classic syntax will be deprecated soon, but it is important to know the "old" syntax and the "new" syntax, so when you see older project, you will recognise this pattern.

Previously `.property()` and `.observes()` were attached to the end of the functions, nowadays we use `Ember.computed()` and `Ember.observer()` functions instead. Let's see in examples.

Old (with ES5 string concatenation):

``` javascript
//...
fullName: function() {
  return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');
}.property('firstName', 'lastName')
//...
```

New (with ES6 string interpolation):

``` javascript
//...
fullName: Ember.computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {
  return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
})
//...
```
So, we will use this new syntax. `Ember.computed()` could have more parameters. First parameters are always those variables/properties in string format, what we would like to use inside our function. The last parameter is a `function()`. Inside in this function we will have access to the properties with `this.get()`. In Ember.js we read properties with `this.get('propertyName')` and update properties with `this.set('propertyName', newValue)`.

Back to our project, and let's play with these new features.

Let's update our html code with input component syntax and add a `value` to our email input box.

Modify `<input>` line as follow in `index.hbs`:

``` handlebars {% raw %}
{{input type="email" value=emailAddress class="form-control" placeholder="Please type your e-mail address." autofocus="autofocus"}}{% endraw %}
```

As you can see, we use `emailAddress` variable, or better word, a "property" where we would like to store the value of the input box.

If you type something in the input box, it will update this variable in the controller as well.

You can use the following code in your controller to demonstrate the differences between computed properties and observers:

``` javascript {% raw %}
//app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  isDisabled: true,
  
  emailAddress: '',
  
  actualEmailAddress: Ember.computed('emailAddress', function() { 
    console.log('actualEmailAddress function is called: ', this.get('emailAddress'));
  }),
  
  emailAddressChanged: Ember.observer('emailAddress', function() { 
    console.log('observer is called', this.get('emailAddress')); 
  })

});
{% endraw %}
```

Observers will be called always when the value of the `emailAddress` changes, the computed property only when you use it. Open your app in your browser, activate Ember Inspector. Click on `/# Routes` section, find the `index` route, in the same line, under `Controller` column, you will see an `>$E` sign, click on it. Open the console in Chrome and you will see something like this: `{% raw %}Ember Inspector ($E):  Class {__nextSuper: undefined, __ember_meta__: Object, __ember1442491471913: "ember443"}{% endraw %}`

If you type the following in the console: `$E.get('actualEmailAddress')`, you should see the above created `console.log` message, that "actualEmailAddress is called". You can try out `$E.set('actualEmailAddress', 'example@example.com')` in the console. What do you see?

Please play with the above examples and try to create your own observers and computed properties.

#### isDisabled with Computed Property

We can rewrite our `isDisabled` with computed property as well.

``` javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  emailAddress: '',

  isDisabled: Ember.computed('emailAddress', function() {
    return this.get('emailAddress') === '';
  })

});
```

There are a few pre defined computed property function, which make your code more shorter. In the following example we use `Ember.computed.empty()`, which checks whether a property is empty or not.

``` javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  emailAddress: '',

  isDisabled: Ember.computed.empty('emailAddress')

});
```

Try out the above example in your code.

* More about `Ember.computed` short syntax: http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.computed.html (Check all the methods on that page.)

#### isValid

Let's go further. It would be more elegant solution if we enable our "Invite me" button only when input box contains a valid email address.

We use `Ember.computed.match()` short computed property function to check the validity of the string. But we need the negated version of this `isValid` computed property. We can use the `Ember.computed.not()` for this.

``` javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  emailAddress: '',

  isValid: Ember.computed.match('emailAddress', /^.+@.+\..+$/),
  isDisabled: Ember.computed.not('isValid')

});
```
Great, it works now as expected. You see, we can write really elegant code with Ember.js, can't we? ;)

#### Add our first Action

Great we have an input box and a button on our screen, but it does nothing at the moment. Let's implement our first action.

Update the `<button>` line in `index.hbs`.

``` handlebars {% raw %}
<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" disabled="{{isDisabled}}" {{action 'saveInvitation'}}>Request invitation</button>{% endraw %}
```

You can try out in your browser, that if you click on the button, you will get a nice error message, which alerts you, that you have to implement this action in your controller. Let's do that.

``` javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  emailAddress: '',

  isValid: Ember.computed.match('emailAddress', /^.+@.+\..+$/),
  isDisabled: Ember.computed.not('isValid'),

  actions: {
  
    saveInvitation() {
      alert(`Saving of the following email address is in progress: ${this.get('emailAddress')}`);
      this.set('responseMessage', `Thank you! We've just saved your email address: ${this.get('emailAddress')}`);
      this.set('emailAddress', '');
    }
  }

});
```
If you click on the button, `saveInvitation` action will be called and shows an alert box, after it will setup a `responseMessage` property, finally deletes the content of `emailAddress`.

We have to show the response message. Extend your template.

``` handlebars {% raw %}
<!-- app/templates/index.hbs -->
<div class="jumbotron text-center">
    <h1>Coming Soon</h1>

    <br/><br/>

    <p>Don't miss our launch date, request an invitation now.</p>

    <div class="form-horizontal form-group form-group-lg row">
        <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-5 col-md-offset-2">
            {{input type="email" value=emailAddress class="form-control" placeholder="Please type your e-mail address." autofocus="autofocus"}}
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-0 col-sm-4 col-md-3">
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block" {{action 'saveInvitation'}} disabled="{{unless isValid 'disabled'}}">Request invitation</button>
        </div>

    </div>

    {{#if responseMessage}}
      <div class="alert alert-success">{{responseMessage}}</div>
    {{/if}}


    <br/><br/>

</div>{% endraw %}
```
We use `{% raw %}{{#if}}{{/if}}{% endraw %}` handlebar helper block to show or hide the alert message. Handlebar conditionals are really powerful. You can use `{% raw %}{{else}}{% endraw %}` as well.

* More about conditionals in templates: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/templates/conditionals/

Brilliant. You learned a lot about Ember.js and you have just implemented these great features.

### Homework

It is time to practice, what you have just learned. 

You already have an amazing `Contact` page, where we would like to add a contact form. In this contact form would be two fields. One field for email address and one field for text message. And there would be a “Send message” button. This button should be active only if email address field not empty and valid and there is some message in the text box. After clicking on “Send message” button should appear an Alert with the email address and the message. When you close the alert message, the form should be cleared and a message should appear in the page in green box, this message could be something about "we got your message and get in touch soon".

Hint: you already have a `contact.hbs` but you need a controller where you manage these logic.

Bonus point if you can add validation to `textarea`. One option, the textarea should not be empty, other option, the length of the message at least 5 characters long.

``` handlebars
{% raw %}{{textarea class="form-control" placeholder="Your message. (At least 5 characters.)" rows="7" value=message}}{% endraw %}
```

Short version of computed property for `greater than or equal`:

    Ember.computed.gte('yourProperty', number)

(Please note, it is `computed.gte` and not `computed.get`.)

If you have two computed property, and both has to be `true` you can use a third computed property with `and`.

    Ember.computed.and('firstComputedProperty', 'secondComputedProperty')

You can get a string computed property length with `.length`. If your computed property is `message`, the length of that message is `message.length`.

* In terms of feedback on a form, there is a really cool solution on bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validation (Check the "With optional icons" section.)

Please try to implement the above requirements. When you finished, you can check in my repository. I am pretty sure, that your solution will be much better than mine. ;) 

## <a name='lesson-3'></a>Lesson 3

### Our first Ember.js Model

We ask email addresses on the home page, but we don't save them at the moment in the database. It is time to implement this feature in our website.

* Please read the detailed introduction on Ember.js website about Ember.js Models: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/models/

Let's create our first model where we save email addresses for invitation. Type the following command in your command line.

    $ ember g model invitation email:string

Hope you read about `store` in the official Guide. Let's use it.

Update your `app/controllers/index.js` controller action. Instead of showing a useless alert message, we try to save our data.

``` javascript {% raw %}
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  headerMessage: 'Coming Soon',
  responseMessage: '',
  emailAddress: '',

  isValid: Ember.computed.match('emailAddress', /^.+@.+\..+$/),
  isDisabled: Ember.computed.not('isValid'),

  actions: {
  
    saveInvitation() {
      const email = this.get('emailAddress');

      const newInvitation = this.store.createRecord('invitation', { email: email });
      newInvitation.save();

      this.set('responseMessage', `Thank you! We've just saved your email address: ${this.get('emailAddress')}`);
      this.set('emailAddress', '');
    }
  }
});
```

Check your browser, open the browser's console. Try to save an invitation email address on home page. You will see an error message in the console.

Ember.js tried to send that data to a server, but we don't have a server yet. Let's build one.

### Setup a server on Firebase

Firebase is a server and API service. Very easy to use. http://www.firebase.com

1. Create an account.
2. Read the guide and help section, especially the instructions about EmberFire: https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ember/guide.html
3. Follow the instructions. First, run the following command in your terminal: `ember install emberfire`
4. Go back to Firebase and create an app there. Remember the name of your app.
5. Update your config file in your Ember.js app. In `config/environment.js` should have a `firebase` property. Update the url with your Firebase app url what you have just created on Firebase website.

``` javascript
// config/environment.js

var ENV = {
        modulePrefix: 'library-app',
        environment: environment,
        contentSecurityPolicy: {
            'connect-src': "'self' https://auth.firebase.com wss://*.firebaseio.com"
        },
        firebase: 'https://WRITE_HERE_YOUR_APP_NAME.firebaseio.com/',
        baseURL: '/',
        locationType: 'auto',
```

Try out Request Invitation button again, check the browser's console messages and open the Firebase website, and check your app dashboard. You will see, that the email address, what you just saved on your home page, is sent to Firebase and it is saved on the server.

Well done!

### Promise and the `this` context in javascript (+ playing with ES5 and ES6 a little)

Promise is a unique asynchronous feature in javascript. Basically an object, which hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future. You can read more about it on Mozilla website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

In our code, we use a Promise: `.save()`

The `save` method on Ember Data Model is a `Promise`. It promises us that it is trying to save our data. It could be successful or maybe return with error.

We can catch the result of a `Promise` with a chained `.then()`. In our example:

``` javascript
newInvitation.save().then(function(response) {
  console.log('Email address is saved.')
})
```

If the saving process is successful, 'fulfilled', then we will get back a response from the server, what we can catch in our function parameter.

We have to move our lines, which showing our success message inside this new function, because we would like to show that message only, when the data is really saved.

If you would simply just copy paste and you use the classic, ES5 JavaScript syntax, you will realize the code will not work as expected. (In the following snippet, I mix the ES5 `function` and ES6 string interpolation syntax. It is not nice.)

``` javascript
newInvitation.save().then(function(response) {
  this.set('responseMessage', `Thank you! We've just saved your email address: ${this.get('emailAddress')}`);
  this.set('emailAddress', '');
})
```

In javascript the `this` points always to that object which is wrapping it around. In the above example, the `this` will be undefined, because we are in a function after the Promise. Please learn more about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this

This kind of problem is nicely solved in ES6/ES2015, in the new JavaScript, what I use mainly in this tutorial. However, no problem, if you see the old, traditional way also. Just for a second, of course.

In ES5 syntax, we have to save the controller context in a local variable. We can use a `_that` inside our `then`.

In ES5 syntax our controller would look like this. (You don't have to use this code in your project. I will show the preferred ES6/ES2015 version after.)

``` javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

    headerMessage: 'Coming Soon',
    responseMessage: '',
    emailAddress: '',

    isValid: Ember.computed.match('emailAddress', /^.+@.+\..+$/),
    isDisabled: Ember.computed.not('isValid'),

    actions: {
    
        saveInvitation: function() {
        
            var _that = this;
            var email = this.get('emailAddress');

            var newInvitation = this.store.createRecord('invitation', {
                email: email
            });
            
            newInvitation.save().then(function(response) {
                _that.set('responseMessage', "Thank you! We saved your email address with the following id: " + response.get('id'));
                _that.set('emailAddress', '');
            });
        }
    }
});
```

We save the `this` controller context in a `_that` local variable. We use this local variable inside our function after the `save()` Promise. The above example uses `response` and shows the `id` of the generated database record. There are a lots of `var`, but in ES2015 JavaScript, we don't use `var` anymore, only `let` and `const`. Good bye `var` and good bye `_that` also. ;)

Let's see the cleaner ES2015 version. (You can use this code in your project.)

``` javascript
// app/controllers/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  headerMessage: 'Coming Soon',
  responseMessage: '',
  emailAddress: '',

  isValid: Ember.computed.match('emailAddress', /^.+@.+\..+$/),
  isDisabled: Ember.computed.not('isValid'),

  actions: {

    saveInvitation() {
      const email = this.get('emailAddress');

      const newInvitation = this.store.createRecord('invitation', {
        email: email
      });

      newInvitation.save().then((response) => {
        this.set('responseMessage', `Thank you! We saved your email address with the following id: ${response.get('id')}`);
        this.set('emailAddress', '');
      });

    }
  }

});
```

You can see the new `=>` syntax here. And we don't need so many `function` keyword as well. The context of the `saveInvitation()` method passed deeper automatically inside our asynchronous callback function. So you can just use a simple `this`. Much nicer and cleaner. Do you like it?

After `save()`, the `response` variable will get back the model from the server. This model object will contain the `id` of our model, the `id` comes from our database. You can use it in the response message.

Great, our home page is ready.

### Create an Admin page

We would like to list out from the database the persisted email addresses.

Let's create a new route and page what we can reach with the following url: `http://localhost:4200/admin/invitations`

    $ ember g route admin/invitations

Add this new page to the `navbar.hbs` with a dropdown.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/navbar.hbs -->
{% raw %}<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-navbar">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      {{#link-to 'index' class="navbar-brand"}}Library App{{/link-to}}
    </div>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="main-navbar">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            {{#link-to 'index' tagName="li"}}<a href>Home</a>{{/link-to}}
            {{#link-to 'about' tagName="li"}}<a href>About</a>{{/link-to}}
            {{#link-to 'contact' tagName="li"}}<a href>Contact</a>{{/link-to}}
      </ul>

      <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
          <li class="dropdown">
              <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Admin<span class="caret"></span></a>
              <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                  {{#link-to 'admin.invitations' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Invitations</a>{{/link-to}}
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>{% endraw %}
```

Add a table to `app/templates/admin/invitations.hbs`

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/admin/invitations.hbs -->

{% raw %}<h1>Invitations</h1>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>E-mail</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    {{#each model as |invitation|}}
        <tr>
            <th>{{invitation.id}}</th>
            <td>{{invitation.email}}</td>
        </tr>
    {{/each}}

    </tbody>
</table>{% endraw %}
```

We use `{% raw %}{{#each}}{{/each}}{% endraw %}` handlebar block helper to generate a list. The `model` variable will contain an array which we will download from the server. Ember.js automatically populates responses from the server. However we have not implemented this step yet.

Let's download our data from the server using a Route Handler and Ember Data.

* Please start here and read the official guide about Route's Model: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.3.0/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/

Add the following code to your `app/routes/admin/invitations.js` file:

``` javascript
// app/routes/admin/invitations.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('invitation');
  }

});
```

Launch your app and check your table in Admin. What do you think? :)

### CRUD interface for libraries

We will implement a new section in our app, where we can create new libraries or list the previously created data.

Firstly we create our `library` model.

    $ ember g model library name:string address:string phone:string

Secondly we create our new route. At the moment we do it without Ember CLI, only manually adding the following lines to our `router.js`:

``` javascript
// app/router.js

import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');

  this.route('admin', function() {
    this.route('invitations');
  });
  
  this.route('libraries', function() {
    this.route('new');
  });
});

export default Router;
```

Now we create 3 new templates. Our main `libraries.hbs`, a `libraries/index.hbs` for list and a `libraries/new.hbs` for new form.

    $ ember g template libraries
    $ ember g template libraries/index
    $ ember g template libraries/new

Update your `navbar.hbs` main navigation section as follow.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/navbar.hbs -->
{% raw %}<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      {{#link-to 'index' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Home</a>{{/link-to}}
      {{#link-to 'libraries' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Libraries</a>{{/link-to}}
      {{#link-to 'about' tagName="li"}}<a href="">About</a>{{/link-to}}
      {{#link-to 'contact' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Contact</a>{{/link-to}}
</ul>{% endraw %}
```

Add a submenu to `libraries.hbs`

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/libraries.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h1>Libraries</h1>

<div class="well">
    <ul class="nav nav-pills">
      {{#link-to 'libraries.index' tagName="li"}}<a href>List all</a>{{/link-to}}
      {{#link-to 'libraries.new' tagName="li"}}<a href>Add new</a>{{/link-to}}
    </ul>
</div>

{{outlet}}{% endraw %}
```

Check your app, you should see a new menu point and there could be two submenu.

Other two templates have the following content.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/libraries/index.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h2>List</h2>

{{#each model as |library|}}
    <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <h3 class="panel-title">{{library.name}}</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Address: {{library.address}}</p>
            <p>Phone: {{library.phone}}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
{{/each}}{% endraw %}
```

We generate a list from our model which will be downloaded in the route. We are using `panel` style from bootstrap here.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/libraries/new.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h2>Add a new local Library</h2>

<div class="form-horizontal">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Name</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            {{input type="text" value=model.name class="form-control" placeholder="The name of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Address</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            {{input type="text" value=model.address class="form-control" placeholder="The address of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Phone</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            {{input type="text" value=model.phone class="form-control" placeholder="The phone number of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" {{action 'saveLibrary' model}}>Add to library list</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

We use `model` as our value store. You will see soon, that our model will be created in the route. The action will call `saveLibrary` function and we pass the `model` parameter to that function.

In your `app/routes` folder create `libraries` folder and add two js files: `index.js` and `new.js`

``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('library');
  }

});
```

We download here all records from the server.


``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/new.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model() {
    return this.store.createRecord('library');
  },

  actions: {
  
    saveLibrary(newLibrary) {
      newLibrary.save().then(() => this.transitionTo('libraries'));
    },

    willTransition() {
      let model = this.controller.get('model');

      if (model.get('isNew')) {
        model.destroyRecord();
      }
    }
  }
});
```

In the above Route we create a new record and it will be the `model`. It automatically appears in the controller and in the template. In the `saveLibrary` action we accept a param and we save that model, after we send the application back to Libraries home page with `transitionTo`.

There is an Ember.js built in action (event) `willTransition`, which will be called when you leave a page (route). In our case, we use this action to reset the model if we haven't saved in the database before.

As you can see, we can access to the controller from the route handler, with `this.controller` method, however we don't have a real controller file for this route (`/libraries/new`). Ember.js dynamic code generation feature automatically creates controllers and route handlers for each route. They exists in memory. In this example `model` property exists in this "virtual" controller and in our template, so we can "destroy" it.

Open your browser and please check these automatically generated routes and controllers in Ember Inspector, under the "Routes" section. You will see how many different elements dynamically created.

What is that nice one liner in `saveLibrary()` method?

``` javascript
 newLibrary.save().then(() => this.transitionTo('libraries'));
```

In ES2015, after `=>` syntax, if we have only one line of code what would be a `return` and something, we can use a more cleaner structure without curly braces and `return`. 
 
 

### Homework

Improve further your Contact Page.

1. Create a `contact` model with `email` and with `message` field.
2. Save that model in the server when someone click on "Send" button on Contact form. Update your `contact.js` controller.
3. Create an Admin page under `http://localhost:4200/admin/contacts`
4. List all saved messages in a table.

Option 2: Refactor your app contact section with usage of model in route. Move validation in model, move action in route and remove contact controller.

## <a name='lesson-4'></a>Lesson 4

### Deploy your app on Firebase

Follow the [guide on Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/ember/guide.html#section-ember-deploy).

    $ npm install -g firebase-tools
    $ ember build --prod
    $ firebase login
    $ firebase init

Update `firebase.json`

    {
      "firebase": "your-app-name",
      "public": "dist",
      "rewrites": [{
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }]
    }

And deploy:

    $ firebase deploy

### Add Delete, Edit button and Edit route

#### Upgrading library list view to grid view

Let's upgrade our `app/templates/libraries/index.hbs` to show a nice grid layout. We have to add a little tweak to our stylesheet as well. You can see, there are two buttons in `panel-footer`. First button is a link to Edit screen, the second is a Delete button with an action. We send `library` as a param with that action call.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/libraries/index.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h2>List</h2>
<div class="row">
  {{#each model as |library|}}
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="panel panel-default library-item">
          <div class="panel-heading">
              <h3 class="panel-title">{{library.name}}</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Address: {{library.address}}</p>
              <p>Phone: {{library.phone}}</p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-footer text-right">
              {{#link-to 'libraries.edit' library.id class='btn btn-success btn-xs'}}Edit{{/link-to}}
              <button class="btn btn-danger btn-xs" {{action 'deleteLibrary' library}}>Delete</button>
          </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>{% endraw %}
```

``` scss
# app/styles/app.scss
@import 'bootstrap';

body {
  padding-top: 20px;
}

html {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

.library-item {
  min-height: 150px;
}
```

If you would try to launch the app now, probably you will get an error message, because we haven't implemented `edit` route yet, and the delete `action` is missing also. Let's implement these.

#### Duplicate some code, create edit.js and edit.hbs

Add manually the new `edit` route to `router.js`. We setup a unique `path:` in the second parameter of `this.route()`. Because there is a `:` sign before the `library_id`, that part of the url will be copied in that variable as route param, and we can use it in our routes. For example, if the url is `http://example.com/libraries/1234/edit`, than `1234` will be passed as a param to route, so we can use in that route to download the model.

``` javascript
// app/router.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');

  this.route('admin', function() {
    this.route('invitations');
    this.route('contacts');
  });
  
  this.route('libraries', function() {
    this.route('new');
    this.route('edit', { path: '/:library_id/edit' });
  });
});

export default Router;
```

After we inserted this extra line in our router, time to create our `app/routes/libraries/edit.js`. You can use Ember CLI or you can create manually. The code should looks like the following. More explanation below. (In this code, I use ES5 syntax, but later I will prefer ES6/ES2015. If you would like you can use ES6/ES2015 already.)

``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/edit.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model(params) {
    return this.store.findRecord('library', params.library_id);
  },

  actions: {

    saveLibrary(newLibrary) {
      newLibrary.save().then(() => this.transitionTo('libraries'));
    },

    willTransition(transition) {
    
      let model = this.controller.get('model');
    
      if (model.get('hasDirtyAttributes')) {
        let confirmation = confirm("Your changes haven't saved yet. Would you like to leave this form?");
  
        if (confirmation) {
          model.rollbackAttributes();
        } else {
          transition.abort();
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

More things happening in this file.

First of all, in the `model` function, we have a `params` parameter. This params will get from the url that `id`. Simply, we can use it with `params.library_id`. The `this.store.findRecord('library', params.library_id);` line download only one record from the server with the given `id`. The `id` comes from the url.

We added two actions as well. The first will save the changes and after redirect to the main `libraries` page.

The second event-action will be called, when we are trying to leave this page, because we redirected from the previous action or the user clicked in a link on the website. In the first case, the changes already saved, but in the second case, it could happen, when the user modified something in the form but haven't saved. It is a typical "dirty checking". We can read the `model` from the controller, we use Ember Model's `hasDirtyAttributes` computed property to check something changed in the model. So we popup an ugly confirmation window. If the user would like to leave the page, we just rollback changes with `model.rollbackAttributes()`. If the user would like to stay in the page we abort the transition with `transition.abort()`. You can see, that we use `transition` variable which is initiated as a param in `willTransition` function. Ember.js automatically provides this for us.

Our template is still missing. Let's use our `new.hbs` and duplicate the code in `edit.hbs` with a little changes. We will fix this problem later with components, because code duplication is not nice.

``` handlebars
{% raw %}<h2>Edit Library</h2>

<div class="form-horizontal">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Name</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=model.name class="form-control" placeholder="The name of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Address</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=model.address class="form-control" placeholder="The address of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Phone</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=model.phone class="form-control" placeholder="The phone number of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" {{action 'saveLibrary' model}}>Save changes</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

If you launch your app, it should work, and you are able to edit the information from a library. You can check what is happening if you modify the data in the form, but finally click on a link somewhere (for example link on the menu) without saving the form data.

#### Add delete action

The delete action is still missing. Let's update `app/routes/libraries/index.js`

``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/index.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('library');
  },

  actions: {

    deleteLibrary(library) {
      let confirmation = confirm('Are you sure?');

      if (confirmation) {
        library.destroyRecord();
      }
    }
  }

})
```

### Homework

You can add delete buttons to your lists on Admin pages, so you can delete invitations and contact messages. It would be nice improvement as well if you could clean up `app/controllers/index.js` and add `createRecord` in `app/routes/index.js`. It would be similar to `libraries/new` section.

## <a name='lesson-5'></a>Lesson 5

### Cleaning up our templates with components

First of all, please read more about Components in Ember.js Guide: http://guides.emberjs.com/v2.1.0/components/defining-a-component/

We can generate a component with `ember g component` command. Let's create two components. First for library panel and one for forms.

```
$ ember g component library-item
$ ember g component library-item-form
```

Each command generates a javascript file and a handlebar file. Javascript part sits in `app/components` folder, the template in `app/templates/components`.

We can insert the following code in the `library-item` template.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/library-item.hbs -->
{% raw %}<div class="panel panel-default library-item">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <h3 class="panel-title">{{item.name}}</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Address: {{item.address}}</p>
        <p>Phone: {{item.phone}}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer text-right">
      {{yield}}
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

You can see, that this code is quite similar what we have in `app/templates/libraries/index.hbs`, however instead of `model` we use `item`.

The most important concept in terms of components, that they are totally independent from the context. They don't know "other things", other variables, only what they originally have and what passed inside with attributes.

We have a `{% raw %}{{yield}}{% endraw %}` which means, that we can use this component as a block component. The code which wrapped with this component will be injected inside the `{% raw %}{{yield}}{% endraw %}`.

For example:

``` handlebars
     {% raw %}{{#library-item item=model}}
        Closed
     {{/library-item}}{% endraw %}
```

In this case the `Closed` text will appear in the panel footer.

Let's add html to our `library-item-form` component as well.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/library-item-form.hbs -->
{% raw %}<div class="form-horizontal">
    <div class="form-group has-feedback {{if item.isValid 'has-success'}}">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Name*</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=item.name class="form-control" placeholder="The name of the Library"}}
          {{#if item.isValid}}<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok form-control-feedback"></span>{{/if}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Address</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=item.address class="form-control" placeholder="The address of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Phone</label>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
          {{input type="text" value=item.phone class="form-control" placeholder="The phone number of the Library"}}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" {{action 'buttonClicked' item}} disabled="{{unless item.isValid 'disabled'}}">{{buttonLabel}}</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

This code is almost the same what we used more times in our form in `libraries/new.hbs` and in `libraries/edit.hbs` templates.

Some tiny improvement. We can add a little validation to our `library` model. Please update `app/models/library.js` with a basic validation, where we check that the `name` is not empty.

``` javascript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  address: DS.attr('string'),
  phone: DS.attr('string'),

  isValid: Ember.computed.notEmpty('name')
});
```

Time to clean up our templates.

Using the `library-item` component in `app/templates/libraries/index.hbs` reduces the code and makes our template more cleaner.

``` handlebars
{% raw %}<h2>List</h2>
<div class="row">
  {{#each model as |library|}}
    <div class="col-md-4">
      {{#library-item item=library}}
        {{#link-to 'libraries.edit' library.id class='btn btn-success btn-xs'}}Edit{{/link-to}}
        <button class="btn btn-danger btn-xs" {{action 'deleteLibrary' library}}>Delete</button>
      {{/library-item}}
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>{% endraw %}
```

We iterate our `model` and we pass deeper in the component that `library` local variable as `item`. The component's variable is always on the left side.

Because this component is a block component, we can add some extra content to the library item footer. In this case, we add an Edit and a Delete button.

You can check your project, you should see the same as before on the Libraries list page, however, the code is cleaner and we have a component, what we can reuse somewhere else as well.

Update our `app/templates/libraries/new.hbs`.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/libraries/new.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h2>Add a new local Library</h2>

<div class="row">

  <div class="col-md-6">
      {{library-item-form item=model buttonLabel='Add to library list' action='saveLibrary'}}
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
      {{#library-item item=model}}
          <br/>
      {{/library-item}}
  </div>

</div>{% endraw %}
```

Update `app/templates/libraries/edit.hbs`.

``` handlebars
{% raw %}<h2>Edit Library</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      {{library-item-form item=model buttonLabel='Save changes' action='saveLibrary'}}
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      {{#library-item item=model}}
        <br/>
      {{/library-item}}
    </div>

</div>{% endraw %}
```

Add action to `library-item-form.js`

``` javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  buttonLabel: 'Save',

  actions: {

    buttonClicked(param) {
      this.sendAction('action', param);
    }

  }
});
```

### Merging `edit.hbs` and `new.hbs` to `form.hbs` and use `renderTemplate()` and `setupController()`

As you can see `edit.hbs` and `new.hbs` are almost the same, so we can use the same template in both route.

Let's create a `form.hbs` which will be our common template in Edit and in New page.

``` handlebars
<!-- /app/templates/libraries/form.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h2>{{title}}</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      {{library-item-form item=model buttonLabel=buttonLabel action='saveLibrary'}}
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      {{#library-item item=model}}
        <br/>
      {{/library-item}}
    </div>

</div>{% endraw %}
```

For using the above common template, we have to do two things. Firstly we have to set `title` and `buttonLabel` params in our controllers, secondly we have to determine somehow, that our template is not the conventional template, we would like to use something unique. Setting controller params in a Route, we can use `setupController` hook, determining a unique template, we can use `renderTemplate` hook.

With the new two hooks our `app/routes/libraries/new.js` would look like this:

``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/new.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model: function () {
    return this.store.createRecord('library');
  },

  setupController: function (controller, model) {
    this._super(controller, model);

    controller.set('title', 'Create a new library');
    controller.set('buttonLabel', 'Create');
  },

  renderTemplate() {
    this.render('libraries/form');
  },

  actions: {

    saveLibrary(newLibrary) {
      newLibrary.save().then(() => this.transitionTo('libraries'));
    },

    willTransition() {
      let model = this.controller.get('model');

      if (model.get('isNew')) {
        model.destroyRecord();
      }
    }
  }
});
```

And our `edit.js`

``` javascript
// app/routes/libraries/edit.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model(params) {
    return this.store.findRecord('library', params.library_id);
  },

  setupController(controller, model) {
    this._super(controller, model);

    controller.set('title', 'Edit library');
    controller.set('buttonLabel', 'Save changes');
  },

  renderTemplate() {
    this.render('libraries/form');
  },

  actions: {

    saveLibrary(newLibrary) {
      newLibrary.save().then(() => this.transitionTo('libraries'));
    },

    willTransition(transition) {
      let model = this.controller.get('model');

      if (model.get('hasDirtyAttributes')) {
        let confirmation = confirm("Your changes haven't saved yet. Would you like to leave this form?");

        if (confirmation) {
          model.rollbackAttributes();
        } else {
          transition.abort();
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```
You can delete the `edit.hbs` and `new.hbs` from `app/templates/libraries/` folder. We don't need them anymore.

###<a name='nav-link-to'></a> Create a tiny bootstrap `nav-link-to` component for `<li><a></a></li>`

Time to clean up our navigation template. We can create a nice component to manage bootstrap `navbar` links properly.

Open your terminal and generate a new component with Ember CLI.

    $ ember g component nav-link-to

Because we would like just slightly modify the main `LinkComponent`, we should just `extend` that class. There is a `tagName` property, which determines the main tag of a component.

Update `app/components/nav-link-to.js`:

``` javascript
// app/components/nav-link-to.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.LinkComponent.extend({
  tagName: 'li'
});
```
Note: don't forget to rewrite `Ember.Component.extend` to `Ember.LinkComponent.extend`.

Our connected template will be the following:

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/nav-link-to.hbs -->
{% raw %}<a href="">{{yield}}</a>{% endraw %}
```

After that we are ready to use our component and we can update our `navbar.hbs`.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/navbar.hbs -->
{% raw %}<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-navbar">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      {{#link-to 'index' class="navbar-brand"}}Library App{{/link-to}}
    </div>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="main-navbar">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            {{#nav-link-to 'index'}}Home{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'libraries'}}Libraries{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'about'}}About{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'contact'}}Contact{{/nav-link-to}}
      </ul>

      <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
          <li class="dropdown">
              <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Admin<span class="caret"></span></a>
              <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                  {{#nav-link-to 'admin.invitations'}}Invitations{{/nav-link-to}}
                  {{#nav-link-to 'admin.contacts'}}Contacts{{/nav-link-to}}
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>{% endraw %}
```

## <a name='lesson-6'></a>Lesson 6

In this lesson we extend our models with `book` and `author`. Setup relation between models. We create a new page, where we using an external js library to generate dummy data to fill up our database automatically.

### Creating some new models and setup relations

In our simple World, we have Libraries. We have Authors, whose could have a few books, however a book could be only in one Library. And one book has only one Author.

To generate new models we use Ember CLI.

Run the followings in your terminal.

```
$ ember g model book title:string releaseYear:date library:belongsTo author:belongsTo
$ ember g model author name:string books:hasMany
```

Add `hasMany` relation to `library` model manually.

``` javascript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  address: DS.attr('string'),
  phone: DS.attr('string'),

  books: DS.hasMany('books'),

  isValid: Ember.computed.notEmpty('name'),
});
```

### Create a new Admin page 'Seeder' and download all models in the same route.

Create a new page using Ember CLI in your terminal:

```
$ ember g route admin/seeder
```

Check `router.js`. A new route should be there which point to `seeder`.

``` javascript
// app/router.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');

  this.route('admin', function() {
    this.route('invitations');
    this.route('contacts');
    this.route('seeder');
  });
  this.route('libraries', function() {
    this.route('new');
    this.route('edit', { path: '/:library_id/edit' });
  });
});

export default Router;
```

Extend your `navbar.hbs` with the new page.

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/navbar.hbs -->
{% raw %}<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-navbar">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      {{#link-to 'index' class="navbar-brand"}}Library App{{/link-to}}
    </div>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="main-navbar">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            {{#nav-link-to 'index'}}Home{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'libraries'}}Libraries{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'about'}}About{{/nav-link-to}}
            {{#nav-link-to 'contact'}}Contact{{/nav-link-to}}
      </ul>

      <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
          <li class="dropdown">
              <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Admin<span class="caret"></span></a>
              <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                  {{#nav-link-to 'admin.invitations'}}Invitations{{/nav-link-to}}
                  {{#nav-link-to 'admin.contacts'}}Contacts{{/nav-link-to}}
                  {{#nav-link-to 'admin.seeder'}}Seeder{{/nav-link-to}}
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>{% endraw %}
```

#### Using `Ember.RSVP.hash()` for downloading more models in the same route

For downloading more models in the same route we have to use `Ember.RSVP.hash()` function in `model` hook.

`RSVP.hash` wraps more promises and return a nicely structured hashed object. More information: http://emberjs.com/api/classes/RSVP.html#method_hash

``` javascript
// app/routes/admin/seeder.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  model() {
    return Ember.RSVP.hash({
      libraries: this.store.findAll('library'),
      books: this.store.findAll('book'),
      authors: this.store.findAll('author')
    })
  },

  setupController(controller, model) {
    controller.set('libraries', model.libraries);
    controller.set('books', model.books);
    controller.set('authors', model.authors);
  }
});
```

RSVP tries to download all model, it will return with fulfilled state only if all three download were successful.

In the `setupController` hook, we split the model and setup new controller properties.

### Little summary about route's hooks

You already use a couple of hook in routes, which will be called in certain sequence.

You can play with it and have a little experiment in one of your route.

``` javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({

  init() {
    debugger
  },

  beforeModel(transition) {
    debugger;
  }

  model(params, transition) {
    debugger;
  },

  afterModel(model, transition) {
    debugger;
  },

  activate() {
    debugger;
  },

  setupController(controller, model) {
    debugger;
  },

  renderTemplate(controller, model) {
    debugger;
  }
});
```

If you visit the route, where your above experiment code was inserted, and you open inspector console in your web browser, the code will stop for debugging in each call. You can see what is the sequence of hooks. The above code follows the pattern.

1. `init()` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_init
2. `beforeModel(transition)` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_beforeModel
3. `model(params, transition)` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_model
4. `afterModel(model, transition)` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_afterModel
5. `activate()` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_activate
6. `setupController(controller, model)` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_setupController
7. `renderTemplate(controller, model)` http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_renderTemplate

### Create number boxes on Admin/Seeder page to see how much data we have in our database

We use a `number-box` component for visualizing numbers on our page. Let's create our fancy component.

```
$ ember g component number-box
```

Setup `css` classes in the component controller.

``` javascript
// app/components/number-box.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({

  classNames: ['panel', 'panel-warning']

});
```

And a little html in our component template:

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/number-box.hbs -->
{% raw %}<div class="panel-heading">
  <h3 class="text-center">{{title}}</h3>
  <h1 class="text-center">{{if number number '...'}}</h1>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

As you see, we can pass in our component two attributes: `title`, `number`.
If we have something in `number` shows that number, if it is empty shows three dots.

Our template is ready, we can use it in our `app/templates/admin/seeder.hbs`

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/admin/seeder.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h1>Seeder, our Data Center</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Libraries" number=libraries.length}}</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Authors" number=authors.length}}</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Books" number=books.length}}</div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

If you open your browser now, you will see three boxes with numbers or with three dots. Remember, we setup `libraries`, `authors` and `books` property in our `setupController` hook, if our `model` hook downloaded our data from the server, those variables are not empty. `.length` method will return a number of the size of that array.

### Building forms to generate dummy data.

We have to generate two other components what we gonna use in this page. Actually we will use only one component, but inside that component we will use an other component. This part is a little bit advance, I don't have a detailed explanation here, but you can copy paste the code and try out. I would suggest, you should play with this code, try to understand. However, don't forget, if you have any question, don't hesitate to ping me on Slack or on Twitter.

Run Ember CLI commands in your terminal.

```
$ ember g component seeder-block
$ ember g component fader-label
```

Insert the following codes in your templates.

``` javascript
// app/components/seeder-block.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({

  actions: {
    generateAction() {
      this.sendAction('generateAction');
    },

    deleteAction() {
      this.sendAction('deleteAction');
    }
  }
});
```

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/seeder-block.hbs -->
{% raw %}<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h3>{{sectionTitle}}</h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="form-horizontal">
        <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Number of new records:</label>
        <div class="col-sm-2">
          {{input value=counter class='form-control'}}
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <button class="btn btn-primary" {{action 'generateAction'}}>Generate {{sectionTitle}}</button>
          {{#fader-label isShowing=createReady}}Created!{{/fader-label}}
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <button class="btn btn-danger" {{action 'deleteAction'}}>Delete All {{sectionTitle}}</button>
          {{#fader-label isShowing=deleteReady}}Deleted!{{/fader-label}}
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>{% endraw %}

```

``` javascript
// app/components/fader-label.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: 'span',

  classNames: ['label label-success label-fade'],
  classNameBindings: ['isShowing:label-show'],

  isShowing: false,

  isShowingChanged: Ember.observer('isShowing', function() {
    Ember.run.later(() => {
      this.set('isShowing', false);
    }, 3000);
  })
});

```

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/components/fader-label.hbs -->
{% raw %}{{yield}}{% endraw %}
```

We need also a little `scss` snippet.

``` scss
// app/styles/app.scss
@import 'bootstrap';

body {
  padding-top: 20px;
}

html {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

.library-item {
  min-height: 150px;
}

.label-fade {
  opacity: 0;
  @include transition(all 0.5s);
  &.label-show {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

```

We have our components, let's insert them in `seeder.hbs`

``` handlebars
<!-- app/templates/admin/seeder.hbs -->
{% raw %}<h1>Seeder, our Data Center</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Libraries" number=libraries.length}}</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Authors" number=authors.length}}</div>
  <div class="col-md-4">{{number-box title="Books" number=books.length}}</div>
</div>

{{seeder-block
    sectionTitle='Libraries'
    counter=librariesCounter
    generateAction='generateLibraries'
    deleteAction='deleteLibraries'
    createReady=libDone
    deleteReady=libDelDone
}}

{{seeder-block
  sectionTitle='Authors with Books'
  counter=authorCounter
  generateAction='generateBooksAndAuthors'
  deleteAction='deleteBooksAndAuthors'
  createReady=authDone
  deleteReady=authDelDone
}}{% endraw %}
```
### Install `faker.js` for dummy data

To generate dummy data we have to install `faker.js`. https://github.com/johnotander/ember-faker

```
$ ember install ember-faker
```

We import `faker` in our models, where we extend each of our models with a `randomize()` function for generating dummy data.

Update your models with the followings.

``` javascript
// app/models/library.js
import DS from 'ember-data';
import Faker from 'faker';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  address: DS.attr('string'),
  phone: DS.attr('string'),

  books: DS.hasMany('book', {inverse: 'library', async: true}),

  isValid: Ember.computed.notEmpty('name'),

  randomize() {
    this.set('name', Faker.company.companyName() + ' Library');
    this.set('address', this._fullAddress());
    this.set('phone', Faker.phone.phoneNumber());

    // If you would like to use in chain.
    return this;
  },

  _fullAddress() {
    return `${Faker.address.streetAddress()}, ${Faker.address.city()}`;
  }
});

```

``` javascript
// app/models/book.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

import DS from 'ember-data';
import Faker from 'faker';

export default DS.Model.extend({

We will implement our actions in our controller.

``` javascript
// app/controllers/admin/seeder.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import Faker from 'faker';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({

  libraries: [],
  books: [],
  authors: [],

  actions: {

    generateLibraries() {
      const counter = parseInt(this.get('librariesCounter'));

      for (let i = 0; i < counter; i++) {
        this.store.createRecord('library').randomize().save().then(() => {
          if (i === counter-1) {
            this.set('librariesCounter', 0);
            this.set('libDone', true);
          }
        });
      }
    },

    deleteLibraries() {
      this._destroyAll(this.get('libraries'));

      this.set('libDelDone', true);
    },

    generateBooksAndAuthors() {
      const counter = parseInt(this.get('authorCounter'));

      for (let i = 0; i < counter; i++) {
        let newAuthor = this.store.createRecord('author');
        newAuthor.randomize()
          .save().then(() => {
             if (i === counter-1) {
               this.set('authorCounter', 0);
               this.set('authDone', true);
             }
          }
        );

        this._generateSomeBooks(newAuthor);
      }
    },

    deleteBooksAndAuthors() {
      this._destroyAll(this.get('books'));
      this._destroyAll(this.get('authors'));

      this.set('authDelDone', true);
    }
  },

  // Private methods

  _generateSomeBooks(author) {
    const bookCounter = Faker.random.number(10);

    for (let j = 0; j < bookCounter; j++) {
      const library = this._selectRandomLibrary();
      this.store.createRecord('book')
        .randomize(author, library)
        .save();
      author.save();
      library.save();
    }
  },

  _selectRandomLibrary() {
    const libraries = this.get('libraries');
    const librariesCounter = libraries.get('length');

    // Create a new array form ids
    const libraryIds = libraries.map((lib) => {return lib.get('id');});
    const randomNumber = Faker.random.number(librariesCounter-1);

    const randomLibrary = libraries.findBy('id', libraryIds[randomNumber]);
    return randomLibrary;
  },

  _destroyAll(records) {
    records.forEach((item) => {
      item.destroyRecord();
    });
  }

});
```
